Q: how should i think of rev p50 < rev actual? so our optimization failed?
A: Short answer: not a failure by itself.

    rev_pred_0.5 is the model's expected (mean) revenue at a price. A single historical revenue_actual point can be higher than the mean and thatâ€™s perfectly normal. What matters is whether actuals mostly sit inside your prediction band and whether the chosen price makes sense given coverage and uncertainty.

    Here's how to think about it:

    When rev_actual > rev_pred_0.5 is OK

        - Mean vs realization: P50 here (with ExpectileGAM(expectile=0.5)) approximates the conditional mean, not a ceiling. Realizations can be above (and below) it.

        - Smoothing: GAM smooths noisy data. True peaks can be damped, so some points will exceed the mean curve.
