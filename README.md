## 3. Data Requirements

This app supports users to provide their own data to generate insights. 
- For external users, please refer to `Section 3.1` to make sure that your data meets the right format
- For Amazon interal users, please refer to `Section 3.2`

### 3.1 External Data Requirements
Table must include following columns (including one row of dummy data)

#### 3.1.2 Pricing dataset: 

  order_date  | asin        | item_name          | shipped_units | revenue_share_amt | asp    | event_name
  ------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------|------------
  2025-07-01   | B00ABCD | Best Dog Food   | 100         | 1299.99           | 12.99  | PD

#### 3.1.2 Product categorization:

  asin        | tag        | variation
  ------------|------------|------------
  B00ABCD | Adult Dog  | 16lb


### 3.2 Internal (Amazon) workflow:

#### 3.2.1 Repo Structure Review

``` bash
pricing/
â”œâ”€â”€ dash/                       # Dash app code
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                       # << data storage folder
â”œâ”€â”€ pricing.sql                 # << main data extraction script
```
#### 3.2.2 Acquire Data 

Run `pricing.sql` in [workbench](https://datacentral.a2z.com/workbench). 

Adjust filters (e.g. for marketplace, time window etc.) as needed.

```
pricing/
â”œâ”€â”€ dash/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pricing.csv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ product_categorization.csv
```
 

## 4. Setup & Run locally

Remember to **ALWAYS** first activate your virtual environment before calling the main `app.py` script.

Windows
```bash
.\.pricing-venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
cd dash
python app.py
# open http://127.0.0.1:8050 in your browser
# stop with CTRL+C
```

macOS / Linux
```bash
source .pricing-venv/bin/activate
cd dash
python app.py
# open http://127.0.0.1:8050 in your browser
# stop with CTRL+C
```

That's it! You can now access the visual results of this Dash app at http://127.0.0.1:8050 on your browser. ðŸŽ‰


## 5. `pricing.sql` documentation (Amazon Internal)

### 5.1 Script functoin summary

  The script enables analysis of:
  - Deal performance by event type
  - Discount depth impact
  - Sales lift during promotions
  - Revenue impact
  - Promotional strategy effectiveness

### 5.2 SQL Script Documentation

The `pricing.sql` script analyzes promotional deal performance through the following steps:

#### 5.2.1. Base Promotion Information
   - Captures promotions based on user definition, e.g. -
     - region_id = 1
     - marketplace = 7
     - GL = 199
     - time window = last 2 years
   - Includes only Approved/Scheduled deals
   - Types: Best Deal, Deal of the Day, Lightning Deal, Event Deal
   - Excludes OIH promotions

#### 5.2.2 Deal Categorization Logic

  The script implements a sophisticated deal categorization system:

  1. Standardized Deal Periods
     - Identifies common start/end dates for major events (Prime Day, Black Friday, etc.)
     - Requires minimum 3 deals with matching patterns to establish standard dates
     - Ensures consistent reporting and analysis

  2. Flexible Event Recognition
     - Accommodates floating date events (e.g., Prime Day in late June or July)
     - Pattern matching in promotion titles:
       - Direct event names (e.g., "Prime Day")
       - Known acronyms (e.g., "PD" for Prime Day)
       - Date-based validation for seasonal events

  3. Event Name Tagging
     - Based on `promotion_internal_title` field
     - Event types:
       - HVE (High Velocity Events)
          - Tier 1: Prime Day, BSS, PBDD, T5/11/12
          - Tier 1.5: Back to School, Back to University
       - Other (Tier 2 +)
         - Defaults to "OTHER" if no matching pattern
      - Excludes promotions with "OIH" in title

  4. Overlap Resolution
     - Prioritizes higher tier events when dates overlap
     - Example priority order:
        - For HVEs, Tier 1 events get the highest priority
          - ... followed by Tier 1.5, Tier 2, Tier 3 etc.
        - Regular promotions


#### 5.2.3. Pre-Deal Baseline Price Calculation (T4W ASP)

   - Calculates 4-week average selling price before promotion
   - Window: 28 days before to 1 day before promotion
   - Filters:
     * Retail merchant sales
     * New condition items
     * Shipped units only


#### 5.2.4. Final Output

   - Combines all previous steps
   - Key metrics:
     * Product identification (ASIN, item name)
     * Pricing (deal price, baseline price)
     * Performance (shipped units, revenue)
     * Event categorization
     * Discount amount
